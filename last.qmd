title: "End the Global Gag Rule"
---

# Support the HER Act

-   An individual's ability to gain crucial reproductive health should not depend on a foreign president\'s decision making.

-   Moreover, the global gag rule has shown to be a failure on a policy level, and has had negative public health effects to communities that rely on these funds.

-   It is for these reasons that I am advocating today to support the HER Act. 

-   If implemented, the HER Act could prevent the global gag rule from ever being active again, regardless of executive order. 

-   The bill has currently been introduced in the House and Senate, but still needs to be passed in both chambers.

-   To support the HER Act, contact your assigned congressman to tell them to support the bill through phone or email
